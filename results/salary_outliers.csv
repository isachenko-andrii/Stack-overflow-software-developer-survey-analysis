if ai advocates are right that we have cheap superintelligence within that time frame, then it seems unlikely there will be any commercial demand for humans to do knowledge work such as programming, as a computer could even do it better. in this scenario, even work such as understanding requirements, design/architecture, and review would be better done by a superintelligent machine.

so, for example, an llm might produce code that is wildly inefficient due to making an excessive number of db calls, and the developer is unlikely to recognize that unless they understand all of the below:

* the majority of dbs are cloud-based, and have network-attached storage (e.g. aws ebs)
* network-attached storage by definition has higher latency than a local disk
* high latency means iops are a somewhat meaningless metric",534640.0,
